# Alert Triage Workflow
This repository contains my assignment submission for the **Alert Triage Workflow** exercise, which demonstrates how a security engineer investigates and resolves cloud security alerts in a SOC environment.

## Overview
Modern cloud-native environments generate a high volume of security alerts across Kubernetes, cloud accounts, IAM, and workloads.  
This design focuses on reducing alert fatigue and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) by providing a clear, risk-based triage workflow with investigation context and guided remediation.

## Notes
- Wireframes are intentionally low-fidelity to focus on clarity, flow, and SOC usability.
- The workflow follows a simple flow: **Alert Inbox → Investigation → Remediation & Resolution**.
- Design decisions are aligned with real-world cloud security and SOC operations.
